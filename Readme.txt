Damien's Quest Read Me (5-23-01)
======================

SOME THINGS TO TAKE NOTE OF:
----------------------------

1. This game is still in Alpha stages, meaning it is barely a game that plays and is just getting the engine to work correctly. There will be lots more graphical enhancments and features that will come in later versions as time progresses so please don't judge it as if it's a finished product, because it is far from one.

2. As soon as the splash screen disappears, your screen should resize to 800x600x16 and let you begin playing. Don't be alarmed by this because your screen will return to it's settings after you exit.

3. If you are wondering, "Have I heard this song before?" you probably have. I am "borrowing" it from Chrono Trigger's soundtrack, the masterpiece of an RPG created for SNES. If people don't mind I might use many of the songs from the game because they are so well made there is no reason to create new ones. I will see when the game nears finish.

4. All files must be in the same folder as the executable file "DQ.exe" unless otherwise noted. All those x#y#.map files are important so don't delete them!

GAME CONTROLS:
--------------

Left Arrow = Walk Left
Right Arrow = Walk Right
Up Arrow = Walk Up
Down Arrow = Walk Down
Space = Shoot a Fireball
E = Read Signs

Currently the keys are unchangeable but I can easily add a feature that allows customization of keys in future updates.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------

I am not too sure how smooth this game runs on old computers because I am developing it on a 1000 Mhz cpu and this game runs perfect. I have done tests on a 550 Mhz cpu and it runs perfect also, so I don't exactly know what the minimum requirements are for smooth gameplay. The current maps are pretty boring and simple but will be more elaborate in later stages of development. This is just to give you a taste of how this game is coming along.

KNOWN BUGS:
-----------

The only bug I know of is a rare bug that sometimes makes the enemy travel over the water. Like I said it is rare but a funny one to see =). I don't know how to fix it but it's not a biggy because he can't harm you once he leaves the map =).

INFO ON THE AUTHOR
------------------

Currently I am a 17 year old senior in high school. My name is Haig Demerdjian and I program in Visual Basic as a hobby. I actually started this project over a year ago in 11th grade but dropped it for many months now. I started production again a few days prior to this ReadMe because people want me to finish my work. So far I have made everything for this game from every line of code to every pixel of graphics, but I sure do need help. I am not an artist so making graphics is difficult for me. I would rather stick with coding the game and having an artist draw me what I need, and I am looking for an artist right now. If you wanted to help out, sorry I am in need of someone I can talk to in person because e-mailing back and forth or chatting online is insufficiant. I am trying to find someone in my school who can help me out. My email address is HDEM2@SOCAL.RR.COM and message me any questions or comments.
